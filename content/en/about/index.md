At the heart of Cali VIP Tours, we find an overflowing passion to uncover the treasures of our city. Our journey began years ago when, exploring every corner of Cali, we discovered the essence that makes it unique: its ANANKE, its unparalleled spirit.

Cali VIP Tours is a project dedicated to showcasing the essence of Cali in a unique way. Our approach takes inspiration from the romantic/gothic novel "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" by Victor Hugo, but instead of an ancient cathedral, we focus on Cali's contemporary treasures. Established in 2023, our team is committed to providing experiences that capture the beauty and history of the city in which we flourish.

Our tours will immerse you in the vibrant life of Cali, merging the city's rich history with its present-day modernity. Just as translator Frederic Shoberl captured a novel's essence in its title, we capture Cali's essence in each of our tours. Just as the story of Notre-Dame unfolds in the Middle Ages, our story unfolds in the charming corners of contemporary Cali.

Join us as we explore the lively streets of Cali, delving into its culture, cuisine, and people. Cali VIP Tours invites you to be part of our story as we together uncover the magic that this city has to offer.
