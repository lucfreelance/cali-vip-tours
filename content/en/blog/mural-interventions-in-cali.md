Angie Llorente, one of the contributing artists, stated to NotiPacífico's cameras: "The idea is to bring the graphics of our fauna, our flora to the bridges, and not to forget the neighborhoods. We want people to know that Cali is not just this area but also includes other neighborhoods and sectors."
